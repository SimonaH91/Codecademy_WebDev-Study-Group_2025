# Codecademy Web Dev Study Group 2025

Welcome to the **Codecademy Web Dev Study Group** repository! This repository is designed to support both the Front-End and Full-Stack study groups by providing a collaborative space for resources, personal projects, and group assignments. Together, we aim to enhance our web development skills while fostering a supportive learning environment.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `/template` - A template file tree for members to copy and personalize.
- `/members` - Personal folders for each group member, named in the format `First_Last`.
- `/resources` - Shared resources, links, and tools provided by the group.
- `/collab` - Collaborative group projects and assignments.

### **Personal File Template**

Each member will create their own folder under `/members/` by following these steps:

1. Copy the `/template/` folder.

2. Paste it into the `/members/` folder.

3. Rename the folder to your name in the format `First_Last`.

4. Edit the `README.md` file inside your folder to include:
